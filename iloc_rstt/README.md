From Seiscomp3 events to location using iLoc
============================================

## Using ISF file approach

Our workflow contains the following steps:

1. Export event xml from the seiscomp3 db. These events initially only have a
few primary stations associations with mostly P arrivals. We will use the `ISF`
 functionality of [iLoc](http://www.seismology.hu/index.php/en/home/iloc).
 Seiscomp3 provides executable (`sccnv`) that allows us to export events into
 ISF format. This is how it works:
    ```bash
    sccnv -i event.xml -o ims10:isf.txt
    ```
2. Record the location (lat/lon) of the event and export primary stations
waveforms (all channels) from all stations within a certain radius of the
event. This radius will be, say, 20% more than the farthest primary station
(from the event location) already associated.

3. If any temporary station falls within this radius, we need to add one or max
two temporary stations waveform (from each temporary stations network).

4. For a primary station for which we already have association, this station
will most likely have an associated P arrival, or may be an S arrival
(confirm). Make sure the vertical channel is associated with the P wave.
(Some rules required here if the P is associated with some other
channels). If we have the S arrival, we are done with that station after
confirming that the S waves came from either the `N` or `E` channels, where
`N` and `E` are the North-South and East-West components at the station.

5. Otherwise, we need to detect S wave arrival for this station. The
procedure is as follows. We take a 50 seconds window (25 seconds either side)
 of the P arrival time and run the (S wave) picking algorithm. Note the time
 of the S arrival and write it (i.e. associate the arrival) in the `ISF`
 event file. We will use `(sqrt(E^2 + N^2))` composite waveform for S wave
 detection.

6. For primary stations for which we don't already have associations (possible
 due to step 2 above), we need to run both the P and S picking algorithms and
 add the picks in the `ISF` file. This is tricky since we have no reference
 arrivals for these station and theoretical 1d arrival times may not exactly
 match that of from the observed waveforms at the stations. We have to run
 our P wave detection algorithm first on a long time window. This process can
  produce multiple picks and we need a process to select/reject such picks.
  We can possibly follow a [`PhasePApy`](https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/PhasePApy) style pick filtering approach.
  Once the P wave is detected, we can follow the same approach as step 5 for
  the S wave detection.

7. We repeat step 6 for temporary station identified in step 3.

8. We run `iloc` on the updated `ISF` file as the following:
    ```bash
    echo "isf_infile=isf.txt isf_outfile=isf.out" | iloc isf > isf.log
    ```

When an arrival is added in the `ISF` file, and used in `iloc`, `iloc`
assumes that the arrival is associated with the event, and runs it's location
 algorithm on all the associated arrivals in the `ISF` file.

## Alternative approach to ISF: Use iloc with seiscomp3 db

According to the `iloc` manual, we can also use events directly from seiscomp3
 db in the following manner:
    ```bash
    echo "event_id update_db=1 do_gridsearch=0 depth=5" | iloc sc3db
    ```

The rest of the workflow remains the same, except the following steps:

1. we need to update the original event xml with the additional picks,
2. insert the updated event into the seiscomp3 db,
3. use the iloc command on this updated event xml, and
4. optionally, insert the updated event back into seiscomp3 db.


## How to run iLoc using SQL with different approaches

1. For one event:
```
echo "`mysql -u alexei -sN -e"select ep.publicID, 'update_db=0 do_gridsearch=0 use_RSTT_PnSn=1 use_RSTT_PgLg=1' from Event e,PublicObject ep where e._oid=ep._oid and ep.publicID = 'quakeml:ga.ga.gov.au/event/00306594'" | sed 's/\t/ /g'`" | iloc sc3db > my.log
```

2. For a subset of events:
```
echo "`mysql -u alexei -sN -e"select ep.publicID, 'update_db=0 do_gridsearch=0 use_RSTT_PnSn=1 use_RSTT_PgLg=1' from Event e,PublicObject ep where e._oid=ep._oid and ep.publicID like '%306%'" | sed 's/\t/ /g'`" | iloc sc3db > subset.log
```

3. For all events:
```
echo "`mysql -u alexei -sN -e"select ep.publicID, 'update_db=0 do_gridsearch=0 use_RSTT_PnSn=1 use_RSTT_PgLg=1' from Event e,PublicObject ep where e._oid=ep._oid" | sed 's/\t/ /gâ€™`" | iloc sc3db > all.log
```

## The combination of ak135 and RSTT locations
In the configuration file use 1 or 0 , where 1 is ak135 and 0 is RSTT
use_RSTT_PnSn=1
use_RSTT_PgLg=1


edit config.txt and change out_agency

out_agency=GAak135

Then run the script:

iloc sc3db < instructions.ak135.txt > ak135.log

## Useful SQL queries to manage event database

Set the verbose level to 3 to get more detailed info about iloc's inner workings.
In particular it lists the sql queries iloc makes.

1. Get_sc3_data

```
echo "quakeml:ga.ga.gov.au/event/00377167 update_db=0 do_gridsearch=0 verbose=3" | iloc sc3db > z.log
```

2. Get_sc3_event, get evid, orid, depth, event type and preferred magnitude id from Event and Origin:
```
select e._oid, o._oid, o.depth_value,
coalesce(e.typeCertainty, 'k'), coalesce(e.type, 'e'),
coalesce(e.preferredMagnitudeID, 'X')
from Event e, Origin o, alexeidb.PublicObject ep, alexeidb.PublicObject op
where ep.publicID='quakeml:ga.ga.gov.au/event/00377167' and ep._oid=e._oid
and op.publicID=preferredOriginID and op._oid=o._oid;
```

3. Get number of origins belonging to an event

```
select count(*) from OriginReference r, alexeidb.PublicObject ep
where ep.publicID='quakeml:ga.ga.gov.au/event/00377167'
and r._parent_oid=ep._oid;
        3 hypocentres
```

4. Get number of associated phase, readings and stations belonging to the
preferred origin

```
select count(r._oid), count(distinct p.waveformID_stationCode, p.waveformID_networkCode)

10. Get arrival data. Note the check for the valid operation time for stations!
This is why you may get an error message from iloc complaining about different
number of phases what it got from query #3

```

## Manipulation of  RSTT

1. Extract nodes from RSTT

```

java -cp "/home/istvan/SLBM_Root.3.0.5.Linux/RSTT_NOGS/RSTT_NOGS.jar:/home/istvan/SLBM_Root.3.0.5.Linux/lib/slbmjni.jar" RSTT.GetNodes /home/istvan/SLBM_Root.3.0.5.Linux/models/rstt201404um.geotess -46 -13 116 156

```

2. Run RSTT_NOGS

```

(in the cloud machine the java part of RSTT is not yet installed)

java -cp "/home/centos/SLBM_Root.3.0.5.Linux/RSTT_NOGS/RSTT_NOGS.jar:/home/centos/SLBM_Root.3.0.5.Linux/lib/slbmjni.jar" RSTT.GetNodes
Usage: GetNodes <full path to RSTT model> latmin latmax lonmin lonmax
         Writes information for nodes in specifed bounds to RSTTnodes.out
         RSTTnodes.out has a node line 'node nodeID activeNodeID lat lon'.  note: nodeID applies to the global model and activeNodeID is a numbering system for the subset of selected nodes
                             crustal layer lines 'layer# depth (km) Vp (km/s) Vs (km/s)'

                   OR

Usage: GetNodes <full path to RSTT model> <nodeIDfile>
         nodeIDfile contains a list of nodeIDs.  The list of nodeIDs is taken from the first column of the file.
         Output is to a file named <nodeIDfile>.nodeInfo.

                   OR

Usage: GetNodes <full path to RSTT model> <nodeIDfileExclude> <anyString>
         Outputs all nodeIDs except the ones listed in nodeIDfileExclude (nodeIDs in first column). Output file is RSTT_nodesMinus<nodeIDfileExclude>.


java -cp "/home/centos/SLBM_Root.3.0.5.Linux/RSTT_NOGS/RSTT_NOGS.jar:/home/centos/SLBM_Root.3.0.5.Linux/lib/slbmjni.jar" RSTT.SetNodes
Usage: SetNodes <input model path> <node update file> <output model path>
         <input model path> is the full path to the file containing the input model.
         <output model path> is the full path to the file containing the output model. The output model file is created if it doesn't exist.
         <node update file> (Use GetNodes for an example) is an ascii file containing the node update information. Multiple nodes can be updated.
            The first line of a node entry is 'node nodeID activeNodeID lat lon'. nodeID must be taken from the input model. activeNodeID is optional and is not currently used.
            9 lines specifying layer depths and velocites follow each node line.
            Lines 1-8 have entries 'layer# depth (km) Vp (km/s) Vs (km/s)' layer# starts with 0.
            Line 9 is similar to lines 1-8 with  additional entries that specify mantle velocity gradient for Vp and Vs. Units for gradient are km/s/km or 1/s.
