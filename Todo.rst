Road Map for HiPerSeis Development
=================================

Fei Zhang 2019-12-16

- Continue to consolidate Best Practices Implementations.

- Reformatting docs to multiple pages for easy navigating.

- More unit tetstings to increase coverage

- Use Pylint/PEP8 coding style to check and score the source code. The current pylint score is low (4.*).

- Updated docs/tutorials for each sub module.

- Integrated installation guide for HiPerSeis including all modules and scripts

- create pip installable package (like obspy)

- when HiPerSeis is mature enough as a Python software package, can try to publish it in **Journal of Open Source Software**
