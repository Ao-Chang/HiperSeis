Instructions for running inventory cleanup on NCI
-------------------------------------------------

These instructions explain how to set up environment on NCI
prior to following the workflow outlined in README.md.

1. Python version
-----------------

As documented in README.md, this scripts in the inventory package
require at least Python 2.7.  Python 3.5 is preferred.

To activate Python 2.7 on NCI, run:

    module load python

Alternately, to activate Python 3.5 on NCI, run:

    module load python3

2. Virtualenv
-------------

It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to isolate the
package requirements of this package from other Python setups. The
README.md explains how to install requirements using pip, but this
should be done after activating the virtual environment.

On NCI, a new virtual environment named 'my_venv' in folder '~/venv/my_env'
is created as follows, depending on whether you're using Python 2.7 or >=3.5:

For Python 2.7:

    module load virtualenv/py2.7
    mkdir ~/venv
    virtualenv ~/venv/my_env
    source ~/venv/my_env/bin/activate

For Python >= 3.5:

    mkdir ~/venv
    pyvenv ~/venv/my_env
    source ~/venv/my_env/bin/activate
    pip install --upgrade pip setuptools

To subsequently leave the virtual environment, simply run:

    deactivate
