This is the distance function used by Brian Kennett in his GHmoho3.f
code. It's used in seismic/receiver_fn/pointsets2grid.py.

kennett-dist needs to be compiled, same as with ellipcorr.

Running "pip install -e . " in the hiperseis directory will take care of ALL this

Alternatively, you can compile it manually by going to hiperseis/kennett_dist 

and 

python -m numpy.f2py -c -m kennet_dist kennett_dist.f 

and moving the resulting '.so' file to the root hiperseis directory.
